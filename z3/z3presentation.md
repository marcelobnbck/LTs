# Z3
Z3 is an efficient and widely used Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver developed by Microsoft Research. It is an automated theorem prover that determines whether a given logical formula is satisfiable (has a solution) or not, and can provide a model (solution) if one exists. As an open-source project on GitHub and provides APIs for several programming languages, including Python, C, C++, Java, and OCaml, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers.

## What is Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)?
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is a technique for automatically checking if complex logical formulas are satisfiable, extending the basic Boolean SAT problem by incorporating specific mathematical domains like integers, real numbers, arrays, and bit-vectors.
